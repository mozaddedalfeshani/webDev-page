                <h1>Why Web Development??</h1>
                <p class="outerDivP">Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It
                    encompasses
                    frontend (user
                    interface), backend (server-side logic), and often database management. Technologies like HTML, CSS,
                    JavaScript, and
                    frameworks such as React and Django are commonly used. It focuses on functionality, usability, and
                    ensuring a seamless
                    user experience across various devices.</p>

                            solutions that positively impact society and contribute to a better, more connected world."
